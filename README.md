# Unit 1 - Asphalt Art

## Introduction

Cities use asphalt art to improve public safety, inspire their residents and visitors, and brighten communities. Your goal is to create asphalt art to revitalize The Neighborhood and bring the community together with the help of the Painter.

## Requirements

Use your knowledge of object-oriented programming, algorithms, the problem solving process, and decomposition strategies to create asphalt art:
- **Create a new subclass** – Create at least one new subclass of the PainterPlus class that is used for a component of the asphalt art design.
- **Plan an algorithm** – Use the problem solving process and decomposition strategies to plan an algorithm that incorporates a combination of sequencing, selection, and/or iteration.
- **Write a method** – Write at least one method in a PainterPlus subclass that contributes to a component of the asphalt art design.
- **Document your code** – Use comments to explain the purpose of the methods and code segments.

## Notes: Neighborhood & Painter Class

This project was created on Code.org's JavaLab platform using the built in Neightborhood GUI output. To test and edit this project you must build in Code.org's JavaLab with the Neighborhood GUI enabled. For reference to the Painter class documentation, [you can read more here.](https://studio.code.org/docs/ide/javalab/classes/Painter)

## Reflection

1. Describe your project.

   - My asphalt project is an art painting of a jellyfish. I used a 16x16 grid to make this painting. My jellyfish is pink and has a little face. I made this painting because I think that jellyfishes are cool and interesting sea creatures. Although they look very harmless, they're extremely dangerous.

2. What are two things about your project that you are proud of?

   - One thing I’m proud of is that I learned how to properly code and make a painting of a jellyfish. Another thing that I’m proud of is that I paid attention to detail and caught bugs in my program early instead of having to go through my whole code at the end.

3. Describe something you would improve or do differently if you had an opportunity to change something about your project.

   - Something I could improve on is my skills with conditions, methods, loops, and variables. I want to be more familiar with them so I don’t struggle as much when adding code into my programs.
